# count-prediction-with-different-ml-models
This repository demonstrates count-based prediction using various machine learning techniques. It includes implementations of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, along with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. The project walks through data preprocessing, model training and evaluation.
